# Windows Batch Files Repository
Batch Files which I use whenever I setup windows.

## How to run these scripts?
First, install NSudo;   
[https://github.com/M2Team/NSudo](https://github.com/M2Team/NSudo)  
(This is only needed for the Windows Defender Disabler)

Then using NSudo, run "Windows Defender Disabler.bat" as a TrustedInstaller with all privileges.   
Alternatively you can do the same for "Windows Defender Enabler.bat" to revert the changes.

To use `Services Disabler.bat`, run it as an admin.  
This script won't disable the MS Store or Xbox Live Auth Services.

## Which versions of Windows, these scripts will work with?
These scripts should work with 20H2 and before and also 21H1 and above.  
(This includes Windows 11 but tested on the leaked Dev Build.)
